# k-means clustering algorithm (a greedy algorithm)
# 1. Pick a k (e.g. k = 2)
# 2. Select k (random) instances for the initial cluster centroids (has an effect on the final resulting clusters… not guaranteed to find the "global" optimal solution, just a "local" optimal solution)
# 3. Assign each instance to the cluster with the “nearest” centroid
# 4. Re-calculate the centroids
# 5. Repeat steps #3-4 until the centroids no longer "move"
